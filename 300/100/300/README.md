# 300 - Run the TextTest fixture from the Command-Line

Your command line should start with ```(venv)```, indicating that you are working inside your virtual environment.

For e.g. 10 days:

``` python
python texttest_fixture.py 10
```

You should make sure the command shown above works when you execute it in a terminal before trying to use TextTest (see next section).
