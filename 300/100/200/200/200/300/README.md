# 300 - Special Items

- **"Aged Brie"** actually increases in `Quality` the older it gets
- **"Sulfuras"**, being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases in `Quality` (Quality is `80` and never alters)
- **"Backstage passes"**, like aged brie, increases in `Quality` as its `SellIn` value approaches:
  - `Quality` increases by `2` when there are `10` days or less
  - `Quality` increases by `3` when there are `5` days or less
  - `Quality` drops to `0` after the concert
