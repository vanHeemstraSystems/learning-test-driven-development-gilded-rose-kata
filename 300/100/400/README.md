# 400 - Run the TextTest approval test that comes with this project

There are instructions in the [TextTest Readme](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/blob/main/texttests/README.md) for setting up TextTest. You will need to specify the Python executable and interpreter in config.gr. Uncomment these lines:

```bash
executable:${TEXTTEST_HOME}/python/texttest_fixture.py
interpreter:python
```
